# Neuro-Symphony — Context experiment (web data collection)

This repository contains the **web application used to collect behavioral data** for the *contextual information manipulation* study described in the dissertation *“Emotions in Music: How Naturalistic Music Listening Encodes Acoustic and Emotional Features in the Brain and Is Shaped by Extra-Musical Context”* (IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, 2025). 

In the study, participants complete an **online, multi-session listening paradigm** in which brief **program-note descriptions** (manipulated in valence and narrative authenticity) are shown before each symphonic movement; during listening, participants continuously report felt affect via a **six-button task**, followed by post-movement questionnaires.
